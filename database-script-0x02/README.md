The sample data was designed to mimic a real-world scenario on a platform like AirBnB.

## Usage
Running the SQL Schema:
- Copy the SQL schema provided in the repository.
- Execute the SQL statements to create the tables and apply constraints in your database system.
- Once the schema is set up, run the INSERT statements to populate the database with sample data.

## Testing Queries:
You can run queries to test the relationships and perform actions like booking a property, making payments, leaving reviews, and sending messages between users.
